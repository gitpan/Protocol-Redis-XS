NAME
    Protocol::Redis::XS - hiredis based parser compatible with
    Protocol::Redis

SYNOPSIS
      use Protocol::Redis::XS;
      my $redis = Protocol::Redis::XS->new;
      $redis->parse("+OK\r\n");
      $redis->get_message;

DESCRIPTION
    This provides a fast parser for the Redis protocol using the code from
    hiredis <http://github.com/antirez/hiredis> and with API compatibility
    with Protocol::Redis.

    (If you've found yourself here just looking to use Redis in Perl: This
    is a low level parsing module, you probably want to look at the modules
    mentioned in "SEE ALSO" first.)

METHODS
    As per Protocol::Redis, API version 1.

  parse($string)
    Parse a chunk of data (calls "on_message" callback if defined and a
    complete message is received).

  get_message
    Return a message. This is a potentially nested data structure, for
    example as follows:

      {
        type => '*',
        data => [
          {
            type => '$',
            data => 'hello'
          }
        ]
      }

  on_message
    Set callback for "parse".

THREADS
    This module will work on a threaded perl and will work with threads,
    however instances of Protcol::Redis should not be shared between
    threads.

SUPPORT
  IRC
    #redis on irc.perl.org <irc://irc.perl.org/redis>

DEVELOPMENT
    See github: <https://github.com/dgl/protocol-redis-xs>.

    Developer note, hiredis is pulled in via a git submodule, run:

     git submodule update --init

    to make the development version buildable.
